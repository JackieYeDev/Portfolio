# Flatiron School - FLEX SE - Phase 2 - Project - Watchlist

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is to fulfill the requirements for Phase 2 of the Flatiron School - Flex SE program.

## Project Requirements

- [ ] Single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
- [ ] At least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
- [ ] At least 3 client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
- [ ] Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
- [ ] You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
- [ ] Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled components or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Material UI) if you prefer.


## Limitations
- 5 API Calls per Minute and 500 API Calls per Day
- Json-server database resets when Heroku sleeps after idling

## Installation

### `npm install`

Install required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
